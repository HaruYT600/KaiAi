# KaiAi - A 16-Year-Old Discord Chatbot

KaiAi is a Discord chatbot that acts like a 16-year-old, created by [@Haruyt600](https://github.com/Haruyt600). Kai can chat naturally with users, respond in DMs, and join conversations in server channels. Whether you're pinging him or just replying, Kai is here to keep the conversation going!

## Features
- **Server Interaction**: Ping or reply to Kai to get him to respond in server channels.
- **DM Conversations**: Kai can chat with you in DMs, but he'll only DM you if you've texted him first.
- **Admin Commands**: Server admins have special controls:
  - `@KAI activate`: Activates Kai in a channel, so he replies even when not mentioned.
  - `@KAI deactivate`: Deactivates Kai in a channel.
  - `@KAI wack`: Makes Kai change the topic of conversation.
  - `@KAI reset`: Resets Kai’s memory in the server.

## Extra Capabilities
- **Image Recognition**: Kai can "see" images shared in the server.
- **Voice Message Listening**: Kai can listen to and respond to voice messages.
- **Image Generation**: Kai has the ability to generate images on demand.
- **Conversation Jumping**: Kai can jump into conversations if he feels like it!

## How to Use
- Mention Kai with `@KAI` in a server or reply to one of his messages to start a conversation.
- As an admin, use the special commands to control how and when Kai interacts with the channel.
- In DMs, Kai is responsive and will keep the chat going, but he won’t initiate unless you text him first.
